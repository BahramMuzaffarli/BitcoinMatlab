## 🔍 Project Overview

**BitcoinMatlab** simulates the process of **buying and selling Bitcoins** using historical or simulated price data. The project focuses on applying **numerical methods** and algorithmic approaches to make trading decisions in a simplified environment.

The main goals are:  

- Understand Bitcoin price behavior  
- Implement algorithms for buying and selling decisions  
- Apply MATLAB skills in numerical computation
